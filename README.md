# MERN Heroku Example

This is a small template for building MERN applications that can be deployed directly to Heroku using git. 

The technology stack is basic MERN. 
* Client is written in React
* Server is a node.js application using express.js
* Mongoose is used to persist data to MongoDB

The application does very little on it's own, but the project demonstrates how you can structure a simple MERN application into a server and a client directory for automated deployment.
